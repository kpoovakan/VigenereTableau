This is a computer program that allows you to decipher any ciphertext created using The Vigenère Tableau cipher.
There are currently two versions of this cipher: one that uses a repeating key word, and another that uses a key letter.
This program only works for the version using the key letter.
The version that uses a key word must be deciphered with the human brain.
